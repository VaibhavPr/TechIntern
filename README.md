Tasks:
1) Predict the Prices of different sports cars from various manufacturers using machine learning algorithms. The accuracy should be more than 80%. The dataset link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/sports-car-prices-dataset
2) You are given a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)where you need to predict whether a person will have heart disease or not. Use various Machine learning algorithms and the accuracy should be more than 80%.
   
3) Make a Artificial Neural network model of deep learning to predict the weather condition (summary) from the weather history dataset.

4) Use transfer learning concept of Convolution neural network CNN to prepare a German traffic sign detection model. The total model should be implemented in a website through
flask. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

5) Prepare a English to French translation website where user will give English language and French translation will be produced. This translation website should be created by training the dataset from scratch and no api should be used to create the model. Use the concept of Natural Language Processing NLP, transformers,etc.
